## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the word ladder game.

## Features
   * Auto mode - choose the start word and the target word and see the ladder with the minimum number of steps to transform the start word into the target.
   * Play mode - choose the number of letters of your dictionary and then play the word ladder. If you find it too difficult there is a hint system which will show you the letter you should replace to get the target word the fastest.
   * Analytics - Will show you the unique words you have gone through in your games.

## Adding new dictionaries

The dictionaries have the name dictionary{n}.txt where {n} is the number of letters. The files must be in the same folder as the executable. By default this repository comes with a dictionary file with 9 words with 4 letters.
